#labels Phase-Design
= Introduction =

This ongoing project aims to serve as a template for J2EE web applications. Several open source frameworks that address common problems/requirements of Java based web development are integrated:
  * Spring MVC
  * Spring Webflow
  * Freemarker
  * Hibernate/JPA
  * Acegi
  * Sitemesh
  * DWR

Petclinic plus is based on the petclinic sample application shipped with the
Spring Framework. To a large extend the project was inspired by Matt Raibles Equinox project which is available at [https://equinox.dev.java.net/].
